@book{Taylor2009,
abstract = {An overall view of the vast spectrum of knowledge needed by practicing rocket scientists and engineers, Introduction to Rocket Science and Engineering presents the history and basics of rocket theory, design, experimentation, testing, and applications. It covers an array of fields, from advanced mathematics, chemistry, and physics to logistics, systems engineering, and politics. The text begins with a discussion on the discovery and development of rockets as well as the basic principles governing rockets and rocket science. It explains why rockets are needed from economic, philosophical, and strategic standpoints and looks at why the physics of the universe forces us to use rockets to complete certain activities. Exploring how rockets work, the author covers the concepts of thrust, momentum, impulse, and the rocket equation, along with the rocket engine, its components, and the physics involved in the generation of the propulsive force. He also presents several different types of rocket engines and discusses the testing of rocket components, subsystems, systems, and complete products. The final chapter stresses the importance of rocket scientists and engineers to think of the unusual, unlikely, and unthinkable when dealing with the complexities of rocketry. Taking students through the process of becoming a rocket scientist or engineer, this text supplies a hands-on understanding of the many facets of rocketry. It provides the ideal foundation for students to continue on their journey in rocket science and engineering.},

They introduce students to the increasingly important role that nonlinearities play in contemporary applications of classical mechanics. Numerical exercises help students to develop skills in how to use computer techniques to solve problems in physics. Mathematical techniques are presented in detail so that the text remains fully accessible to students who have not had an intermediate course in classical mechanics.},

@article{Sweetser1991,
abstract = {An estimate is found for a lower bound on the $\Delta$V needed for any trajectory which starts at 167 km altitude circular Earth orbit and ends in a 100 km altitude circular polar Lunar orbit. The analysis used involves calculations of Jacobi's intergral in a circular restricted three-body problem which approximates the Earth-Moon transfer problem. The result is an estimate that any such trajectory will require $\Delta$Vs of at least 3.099 km/s to leave the neighborhood of Earth and at least 0.622 km/s to achieve the desired orbit around the Moon, for a total of 3.721 km/s. Whether a trajectory exists which actually uses this $\Delta$V is not presently known, although recently Belbruno and Miller found an actual Earth-Moon trajectory which takes advantage of solar perturbations to achieve a transfer which has an injection $\Delta$V from Earth orbit of 3.187 km/s and an insertion $\Delta$V into Lunar orbit of 0.651 km/s.},

abstract = {We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech—two vastly different languages. Be- cause it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural net- works, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech includ- ing noisy environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system [26]. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior ar- chitectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, deliver- ing low latency when serving users at scale.},

@article{Graves2006,
abstract = {Many real-world sequence learning tasks re- quire the prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data. In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their out- puts into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label un- segmented sequences directly, thereby solv- ing both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its ad- vantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

@inproceedings{Topputo2005,
abstract = {In the frame of the lunar exploration, numerous future space missions will require maximization of payload mass, and simultaneously achieving reasonable transfer times. To fulfill this request, low energy non-Keplerian orbits could be used to reach the Moon instead of high energetic transfers. The low energy solutions can be separated into two main categories depending on the nature of the trajectory approaching the Moon: low energy transit orbits that approach the Moon from the interior equilibrium point L(1) and weak stability boundary transfers that reach the Moon after passing through L(2). This paper proposes an alternative way to exploit the opportunities offered by L(1) transit orbits for the design of Earth-Moon transfers. First, in a neighborhood of the L(1) point, the three-body dynamics is linearized and written in normal form; then the entire family of nonlinear transit orbits is obtained by selecting the appropriate nontrivial amplitudes associated with the hyperbolic part. The L(1)-Earth arc is close to a 5:2 resonant orbit with the Moon, whose perturbations cause the apogee to rise. In a second step, two selected low altitude parking orbits around the Earth and the Moon are linked with the transit orbit by means of two three-body Lambert arcs, solutions of two two-point boundary value problems. The resulting Earth-to-Moon trajectories prove to be very efficient in the Moon captured arc and save approximately 100 m/sec in Deltav cost when compared to the Hohmann transfer. Furthermore, such solutions demonstrate that Moon capture could be obtained in the frame of the Earth-Moon R3BP neglecting the presence of the Sun.},
